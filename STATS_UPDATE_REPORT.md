# 📊 ServiceHub Stats Update Report

## ✅ **Updates Completed Successfully**

All platform stats have been updated to reflect accurate data from the database across all pages and components.

---

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### 1. **Backend API Fix** (`/app/backend/database.py`)
- **Fixed `get_platform_stats()` method** to query the correct collections:
  - Changed from non-existent `tradespeople` collection to `users` collection with `role: "tradesperson"`
  - Updated category counting logic to use static + custom trade categories
  - Improved active jobs counting logic

### 2. **Frontend Fallback Stats** (`/app/frontend/src/components/StatsSection.jsx`)
- **Updated hardcoded fallback stats** to match current platform data:
  - Registered tradespeople: `201` → `52`
  - Trade categories: `28+` (unchanged - was already correct)
  - Customer reviews: `403` → `40`

## 📈 **Before vs After**

| Metric | Before | After | Status |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Registered Tradespeople** | 100 (API) / 201 (fallback) | **52** | ✅ Fixed |
