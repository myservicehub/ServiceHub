The AI engineer's work throughout this trajectory has been highly iterative and focused on both feature development and critical bug fixes within the  application. Starting with a request to hide Paid Access UI elements, the engineer then addressed a series of frontend and backend bugs. Key fixes included resolving blank category/location fields on the interested tradespeople page (due to incorrect API calls), a persistent React Maximum update depth exceeded error (traced to a  hook dependency issue and later to unmemoized functions in ), and a login modal overlay issue preventing interaction. Feature enhancements included converting the 'town' field to a text input in the job edit form, restricting job editing to only budget fields for homeowners, hiding access fee details, enabling correct display of cancelled jobs, implementing chat disablement for completed/cancelled jobs, and creating a dedicated Completed Jobs page for tradespeople with associated backend API and notification logic for job status changes. The most recent interaction involves a user request to fix a white button with unreadable text.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer received a user request: Update the white to button, because I can’t see what’s written on it. The user also provided a screenshot () showing a white button with unreadable text. This indicates a UI/UX issue where the text color contrasts poorly with the button's background, making the call to action or information on the button invisible or very difficult to read. The engineer has just received this explicit instruction and needs to investigate the relevant button's styling (likely in a  component or specific page JSX) to adjust its  or  properties to ensure readability. No changes have been made yet to address this specific issue.
