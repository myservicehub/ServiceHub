The AI engineer successfully built a full-stack application, , starting from a clone of MyBuilder.com. The process was iterative, first creating a pixel-perfect frontend with mock data, then implementing a FastAPI backend with MongoDB. Key user requests included adapting the application for the Nigerian market, rebranding it to  with custom colors and logo, and adding core functionalities like job posting and user authentication. The engineer consistently used  and  for validation and research. The work transitioned smoothly from frontend to backend integration, addressing several bugs found during automated backend testing. The current state reflects a robust, authenticated platform with job posting, moving towards quote management.

<product_requirements>
The initial requirement was to create a pixel-perfect clone of MyBuilder.com, replicating its design, layout, colors, fonts, images, animations, and structure, ensuring responsive behavior. This included a hero section with search, statistics, a how it works section, popular trades, reviews, a mobile app promotion, and a join tradespeople section.

Following the clone, the user explicitly requested:
1.  **Backend Development**: To make the application full-stack with real functionality, replacing mocked data.
2.  **Nigerian Market Adaptation**: To tailor the application for Nigeria, including using Nigerian cities, currency (Naira), phone formats, trade categories, and certifications.
3.  **Rebranding**: To change the application's name from MyBuilder to serviceHub across all elements.
4.  **Brand Color Update**: To implement specific brand colors (Navy Blue: , Service Green: , Light Gray: , Pure White: ) and typography (Montserrat Bold, Lato Regular).
5.  **Logo Integration**: To add a specific custom logo (green circle with person icon, Service in navy, Hub in green).
6.  **Job Posting Functionality**: To enable homeowners to post jobs through a multi-step form.
7.  **User Authentication**: To implement a comprehensive sign-up/login system for both homeowners and tradespeople.
8.  **Quote Management**: To allow tradespeople to respond to jobs with detailed quotes, and homeowners to review and manage them.

The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:



**Key Files and their importance:**

-   : The main FastAPI application entry point. It registers all API routes ( prefix) and middleware (CORS). It was modified to include  and  routes.
-   : Defines Pydantic models for user authentication (e.g., , , ). Crucial for data validation and consistency in auth processes.
-   : Handles security-related operations like password hashing (bcrypt), JWT token creation, and verification. Essential for securing user data and sessions.
-   : Contains API endpoints for user registration, login, and potentially user information retrieval. Integrates with  and .
-   : Contains API endpoints for creating, retrieving, and managing quotes. It was recently enhanced to support comprehensive quote management.
-   : Used to populate the MongoDB database with initial data (tradespeople, jobs, reviews, stats). It was crucial for populating Nigerian-specific data and rebranding content.
-   : The main React application file. It defines the routing structure using  and . It was updated to include  and  routes, and wrapped with .
-   : A newly created reusable component to display the  logo consistently across the application, matching the precise brand design.
-   : The application's navigation bar. It was heavily modified to include the  logo, authentication buttons (Sign in, Join serviceHub), and the Post a job link.
-   : Implements the multi-step form for homeowners to post job details. It incorporates Nigerian-specific data.
-   : A modal component that encapsulates  and , providing a unified authentication experience.
-   : Provides a React context for managing user authentication state across the frontend, including login/logout functions and user data.
-   : Centralizes Axios configurations and handles authorization headers for API requests. It was updated to include auth token handling.
-   : A newly created page for tradespeople to view available job postings.
-   : Component for tradespeople to submit quotes for jobs.
-   : Component for homeowners to view and manage received quotes.
-   : Contains global CSS styles, including Tailwind CSS directives and custom CSS variables for ShadCN UI, which were updated to reflect brand colors.
-   : Tailwind CSS configuration file, extended to include custom brand colors in the color palette.
-   : Documents API contracts, mocked data, backend implementation plans, and frontend-backend integration protocols.
-   : Summarizes all changes made to localize the application for the Nigerian market.
-   : Documents the changes made during the rebranding from MyBuilder to serviceHub.
-   : Details the successful implementation of the specific brand color palette and typography.
-   : Summarizes the integration of the custom serviceHub logo.
-   : Documents the features and flow of the implemented job posting system.
-   : Summarizes the implemented user authentication features and flows.

<pending_tasks>
-   **User Profiles**: Detailed profile pages and management for both homeowners and tradespeople.
-   **Payment Integration**: Implement Nigerian payment systems (Paystack/Flutterwave).
-   **Notifications**: Implement email/SMS notifications for job updates, quotes, etc.
-   **Deployment**: Deploy the application to make it publicly accessible.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing the **Quote Management** system. This involves allowing tradespeople to submit quotes for posted jobs and enabling homeowners to review and manage these quotes.

**Backend progress**:
-   The backend now has enhanced API endpoints for quotes in .
-   Database methods (likely in  or ) have been updated to support comprehensive quote management.

**Frontend progress**:
-   API services for quote management have been added (likely within  and potentially a new ).
-   Frontend components for quote submission () and displaying quotes () have been created.
-   A new page for tradespeople to browse available jobs () has been created.

The trajectory ended with the AI engineer explicitly stating: Let me continue by creating a page for homeowners to view and manage quotes on their jobs. This indicates that the core components for quote submission and display are in place, but the integration into a dedicated homeowner-facing page for quote review/management is the immediate next step. The system is set up for multi-role interaction, with job posters (homeowners) and responders (tradespeople) being central.
