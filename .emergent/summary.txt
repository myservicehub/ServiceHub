The AI engineer systematically tackled a series of bugs and feature enhancements across the  application. Initial efforts focused on verifying and fixing the Admin Dashboard's Job Access Fees, resolving React state update issues in , and rectifying Review/Edit button functionality in Job Approvals. Subsequent work addressed persistent Unknown Homeowner display bugs in both Job Approvals and Job Access Fees by correcting data structures and API mappings in both backend and frontend. The policy management module, initially failing to load data, was fixed by refining MongoDB queries and adding robust error handling. A critical bug involving hardcoded trade categories in the frontend was resolved by implementing dynamic API fetching for , , and  components. The current task involves developing comprehensive user management features in the Admin Dashboard, including detailed user views and account deletion, with initial frontend and API client modifications complete, pending backend route creation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on implementing comprehensive user management features within the Admin Dashboard. The user explicitly requested the ability to view users full details and to be able to delete users account. The engineer started by investigating the existing user management section in , which showed a list of users with basic details and View and Suspend buttons. The plan is to enhance the View functionality to open a detailed modal, add a Delete button with confirmation, and create corresponding backend API endpoints.

Current progress includes:
1.  **Frontend Modifications**:
    *   Added new state variables (, , , ) in  to manage modal visibility and data.
    *   Implemented handler functions (, , ) in .
    *   Updated the user management table's action buttons in  to trigger these new handlers.
    *   Added two new React modals ( and ) to .
    *   Added new API client methods (, ) to .
2.  **Backend Task**: The engineer confirmed that the corresponding backend API endpoints for getting user details () and deleting users () do not yet exist in .
